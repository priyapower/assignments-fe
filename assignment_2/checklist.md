## Instructions:
- See details for mockups for: desktop, tablet, and mobile views
- ✅ Create a repo for your assignments
- ✅ Create a GH page associated with assignments repo (this is the url you provide for peer review)
- ✅ Create a folder in repo for the solution for assignment 2
- ✅ Create an `index.html` file inside assignment folder

---
- Following the mockups, create a single, responsive page that works in all three enviromments: desktop, tablet, and mobile:
    - ✅ Ensure you are using a CSS file placed in a `css` folder as a sibling to your `index.html`
    	- No in-line CSS
    	- No CSS/JS framework (including Twitter Bootstrap)
    	- ✅ Hint: you can start with the simple responsive framework developed in lecture 24 
    - [ ] You **must** implement the following breakpoints
    	- [ ] Desktop: width of the browser window is 992px and above
    	- [ ] Tablet: width of the browser window is between 768px and 991px, inclusively
    	- [ ] Mobile: width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px
    - [ ] Create 3 sections that each contain some text (you can use dummy text). 
    	- The sections lay depending on browser width
    	- Hint: use media queries discussed in Lecture 23
    	- [ ] DESKTOP: (992px and above) each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen
    		- As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower
    		- Hint: use percentages to define width and use the 'float' property. See Lecture 24
    	- [ ] TABLET: (between 768px and 991px, inclusively) the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size
    		- The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself
    	- [ ] MOBILE: (equal to or less than 767px), each section should take up the entire row
    - [ ] Create a page heading
    - [ ] Create section titles
    	- Copy the titles from the mockup illustration (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi) or come up with your own
      - Hint: use relative and absolute positioning and offsets as discussed in Lecture 22
      - [ ] Each section should have a section title region that is always positioned at the top right corner of the section
    - [ ] Spacing
      - Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations
      - Hint: use margins and padding and use border-box as your box-sizing as discussed in Lecture 19
      - [ ] Is the spacing inside a section appropriate?
      - [ ] Is your spacing between sections appropriate?
      - [ ] Is their passing in the section between the title and the text?
      - [ ] Is the spacing between browser edge appropriate?
      - [ ] Is the spacing between title and sections appropriate?
      - [ ] Is the spacing appropriate when changing views?
    - [ ] Borders and Colors
      - [ ] Each section has a unique background color
        - [ ] Section text should contrast with the background color
      - [ ] Each section title should have a unique background color
        - [ ] Section title text should contrast with the background color
      - [ ] Set a _black_ border on each section and section title that is 1px thick
    - [ ] Font
      - [ ] Set a font-family for the text in your page
      - [ ] Set the font size of the heading to be 75% larger than the font size of the dummy text
      - [ ] Set the section title to be 25% larger than the font size of the dummy text
